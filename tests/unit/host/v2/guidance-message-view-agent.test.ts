/**
 * Issue #3320 AC4 — v1 message views must carry the native agent identity.
 *
 * `onV2ContextEvent` seeds identity from `event.agent` (an Agent.Info object,
 * e.g. `{ id: 'plan' }`), but `toV1MessageView` (src/host/v2/guidance.ts)
 * builds views whose `info` carries ONLY `{ id, role, sessionID }` — the
 * `agent` field is dropped. Downstream v1-chain stages key exclusively on
 * `info.agent` (pipeline-tracker.ts, delegation-gate.ts messagesTransform),
 * so on v2 a `plan`/`build` session is indistinguishable from the architect
 * main session and receives architect-only injections every step.
 *
 * Expected behavior: the translated USER view's `info` includes
 * `agent: '<Agent.Info.id>'` when the event carries an agent; a view for an
 * agent-less event carries NO agent stamp (selective stamping — the main
 * session must keep its identity-absent semantics).
 *
 * RED at base, GREEN after the fix: the first test fails at base because
 * `info.agent` is undefined. The second test (negative control) passes at
 * base and must KEEP passing after the fix.
